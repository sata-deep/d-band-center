# d-band-center Program
This code calculates the d-band centers (spin up and spin down) from a VASP calculation with LORBIT=11 and prints the _effective d-band center_
given by

The file required is VASP-DOSCAR file.
use LORBIT = 11 in the DOS calculation.

**To use the code:**
1. Go to src directory
2. Please check the FC= in the Makefile
3. Type make
4. Run the executable DOSutility from where you have the DOSCAR file.

Use Total d-DOS option (1) to print the d-band centers. Once the atoms are selected the code prints the 
d-DOS for the up and down electrons for the selected atoms in a file called **d-ud.dat** (in addition to printing the d-band centers 
of those selected atoms). 

While performing DOS calculation care should be taken (in the POSCAR file) such that all transition metals for which the d-band center 
to be calculated should appear together.
