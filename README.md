# d-band-center Program

This code calculates the d-band centers (spin up and spin down) from a VASP calculation with LORBIT=11 and prints the _effective d-band center_
given by

Here $f_\uparrow$ and $f_\downarrow$ are the fractional occupancy of the d-states. 

$\epsilon_{d\uparrow}$ and $\epsilon_{d\downarrow}$ are the d-band center for the spin-up band and spin-down band respectively.

The file required is VASP-DOSCAR file.
use LORBIT = 11 in the DOS calculation.

**To use the code:**
1. Go to src directory
2. Please check the FC= in the Makefile
3. Type make
4. Run the executable DOSutility from where you have the DOSCAR file.

Use Total d-DOS option (1) to print the d-band centers. Once the atoms are selected the code prints the 
d-DOS for the up and down electrons for the selected atoms in a file called **d-ud.dat** (in addition to printing the d-band centers 
of those selected atoms). 

While performing DOS calculation care should be taken (in the POSCAR file) such that all transition metals for which the d-band center 
to be calculated should appear together.

If you use this code, please cite the following article:

Other than the above, the code can also print the spin-polarization at the Fermi energy

$P=\frac{D_\uparrow(E_F)-D_\downarrow(E_F)}{D_\uparrow(E_F)+D_\downarrow(E_F)}$
